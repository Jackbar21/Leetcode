# Leetcode

Now that I have graduated and entered the work-force, I want to ensure I am still learning and staying sharp. I haven't done any leetcode since third-year, when I was able to secure an internship offer for a few companies, including Amazon and Microsoft. The goal of this repo is to do about an hour of leetcode every day for the next year, which will help me get my edge back while reviving my old github.

If I am able to stay consistent with this goal, it would make for a pretty nice widget on a personal site. I will start off doing these in Python, so as to initially make building this habit as easy as possible, but eventually go back-and-forth (and transition over completely) to C#, as that's be the primary language I will be coding in at my new job.

This decision was heavily inspired from reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, who emphasizes the power of habit and the compounding that comes from becoming 1% better every day.
